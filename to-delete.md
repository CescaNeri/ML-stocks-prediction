# Random Ideas

- Add financial indicators from finTa library (as a column ?)
- Add relevant data to the table to increase accuracy 
    - primary key: date
    - stock price of stakeholders:
        - major clients (boh, videogames I guess)
        - key partners that are listed in the SE
        - *maybe we can add competitors' trend* (intel & AMD)
    

Additional data may be useful for the analysis BUT we should also select the most appropriate period.
(if we include the stock price of a main customers, it can be misleading with past data, when the company in question wasn't a nvidia customer)
